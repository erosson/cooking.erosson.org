# Chia Egg

A vegan egg substitute used in baking. Like all egg substitutes, it's not a replacement for *every* case, but it works for *many* cases. I bake with these all the time.

Based on <cite>https://minimalistbaker.com/make-chia-egg/</cite>

### Ingredients 
* 1 tbsp chia seeds
* 3 tbsp water

### Directions
1. Mix the chia seeds and the water. (I find a wider, shallower cup or bowl is slightly better, but cup/bowl will work.)
2. Let sit for 5 minutes.

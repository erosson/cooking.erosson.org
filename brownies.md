# Coconut Banana Brownies

Evan's favorite vegan brownies.

This recipe uses a 13"Ã—9" baking tray. [I like this baking tray](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MUGM60E/), but any will do. These brownies will stick to some baking trays, so be sure to grease nonstick trays with a bit of oil.

This recipe uses both a chia egg and a banana as its egg substitutes/binding agents. There are many options for egg substitutes - you could use two bananas, or two chia eggs, or another egg substitute like applesauce, or another combination. I've experimented with these, and like the combination used here the most: two bananas adds a much stronger banana flavor; two chia eggs affects the brownie texture and loses the nice hint of banana flavor.

[Surprisingly, most sugar is not vegan](https://www.peta.org/living/food/is-sugar-vegan/). Use sugar labeled "organic" or "vegan" for truly cruelty-free brownies. I'm a fan of [Zulka](https://zulka.com/): it's widely available near me, and not much more expensive than non-vegan sugar.

Based on the (non-vegan) brownie recipe on the back of boxed brownie mix, and many of my own experiments. 

### Ingredients
* 1 [chia egg](chia-egg.md) > 1 tbsp chia seeds, 3 tbsp water
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 1 cup vegan sugar
* 1 banana
* 1/2 cup coconut oil
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 handful of coconut flakes (optional)

### Directions
1. Prepare the [chia egg](chia-egg.md): combine the chia seeds and water in a cup or bowl, then set aside
2. Prepare the brownie mix: combine the sugar, flour, and cocoa powder in a large mixing bowl. Whisk until smooth.
3. Blend the banana with a mixer, or mash by hand, until mostly smooth.
4. Combine the brownie mix with all other ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix until smooth, using either a hand mixer or a mixing spoon.
5. Pour the mix into a greased/nonstick 13" x 9" baking tray.
  * Optionally, sprinkle some coconut flakes on top of the brownies after pouring. 
6. Bake at 350f for 27 minutes. Baking is done when an inserted fork comes out clean.
7. Remove from oven. Let cool for 10 minutes.
8. Enjoy!

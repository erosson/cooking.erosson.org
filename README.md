# Evan's Recipes

This is my deliberately simple cooking website.

### Baking

I've been making lots of cakes lately! [Photos of my cakes are here](https://mastodon.social/@erosson).

https://www.noracooks.com/ is my favorite place to look for new baking recipes. (Naturally I'll search with Google, but tend to click noracooks links first.) I'll often try different egg substitutes, based on what I like most and what I have in the kitchen.

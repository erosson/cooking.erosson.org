# Evan's Recipes

This is my deliberately simple cooking website.

I'm making lots of cakes these days! <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@erosson">Photos of my cakes are here</a>; it's like my only social media

### Baking

* [Coconut banana brownies](brownies.md)
* [Chocolate cake/cupcakes and chocolate frosting (via Noracooks)](https://www.justtherecipe.com/?url=https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chocolate-cake/), with the following modifications:
  * Cake base: substitute [applesauce] for [1 banana + 2 [chia eggs](https://cooking.erosson.org/chia-egg)]. After lots of experiments, this is my favorite egg substitute
  * Cake base and frosting: coconut oil is best. It melts when it's hot enough outside, so store in the fridge when possible
  * Cake frosting: I use 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of (expensive and mysterious) fake butter
* [Vanilla frosting (via Noracooks)](https://www.justtherecipe.com/?url=https://www.noracooks.com/vanilla-vegan-frosting/)
  * [For an oreo cake](https://mastodon.social/web/@erosson/109000125250869336), blend the frosting with oreo cookies
* [Vanilla cake (via Noracooks)](https://www.justtherecipe.com/?url=https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-vanilla-cake/)
  * Cake base: for your egg substitute, use aquafaba as recommended in the recipe, or two bananas. Don't use chia eggs: they taste fine, but the dark chia seeds against a light-colored vanilla cake aren't very aesthetic.
* [Strawberry frosting (via LifeLoveAndSugar)](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/homemade-strawberry-frosting-two-ways/#tasty-recipes-37440)
* [Strawberry shortcake (via FlouredFrame)](https://flouredframe.com/vegan-strawberry-shortcake/)
  * Many other recipes use biscuits, but this recipe's more my style - I grew up eating tiny one-person shortcakes
  * I've made this with commercial fake-heavy-cream, but it's very hard to find in stores. TODO: try more common heavy-cream substitutes, like coconut cream

#### Not yet attempted

* pumpkin pie cupcakes: https://www.thelittleblogofvegan.com/2022/09/mini-vegan-pumpkin-pies.html

https://www.noracooks.com/ is my favorite place to look for new baking recipes. Naturally I'll search with Google, but tend to click noracooks links first.

I'll often try different egg substitutes, based on what I like most and what I have in the kitchen, but a mixture of banana and/or chia-eggs is usually my favorite.
